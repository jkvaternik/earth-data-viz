      <h1>CO2 Emissions</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>CO2 emissions are the main contributor to global warming on
        Planet Earth, which has several other sideaffects such as
        melting ice caps, more severe weather, and bleaching of coral
        reefs. The main source of CO2 comes from the burning of fossil
        fules. Therefore, in this section we will focus on carbon
        emissions and energy production for every country contributing
        to our planetary crisis. </p>
      <h3>Example Insights</h3>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>In this section, I display the process of coming up with my final visualizations.</p>
      <h4>Energy Production Over Time</h4>
      <p>For this visualization, I originally tried creating a bar chart for each country, and having a user input scroll bar to 
        choose what year the bar charts represented. The idea was to convey how the distributions of energy types changed over time.
      </p>
      <div id="observablehq-viewof-distributionYear-d25631b5"></div>
<div id="observablehq-viewof-energyDistributions-d25631b5"></div>

<script type="module">
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";
import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@akaufmann038/final-project.js?v=3";
new Runtime().module(define, name => {
  if (name === "viewof distributionYear") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-viewof-distributionYear-d25631b5"));
  if (name === "viewof energyDistributions") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-viewof-energyDistributions-d25631b5"));
  return ["getData","energyDistributions","getEnergyViz","energyAndCo2Plot"].includes(name);
});
</script>
      <p>The issue with this visualization is that it did not effectively show how the distributions changed over time. I ended up 
        using area charts for each country to show the distributions of energy production over time.
      </p>
      <h4>What contributes to CO2 emissions.</h4>
      <p>In this visualization, I wanted to show which energy types contributed most to CO2 emissions. I attempted to do this by 
        normalizing the data by calculating the standard deviations of CO2 and all of the energy types.</p>
        <div id="observablehq-viewof-stdLineChart-c20ea3d7"></div>


<script type="module">
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";
import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@akaufmann038/final-project.js?v=3";
new Runtime().module(define, name => {
  if (name === "viewof stdLineChart") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-viewof-stdLineChart-c20ea3d7"));
});
</script>
      <p>This issue with this visualization was that there was no clear way to interpret the fluctuations in the lines since 
        my unit was a standard deviation. I ended up displaying CO2 emissions and the distributions of energy types next to each other 
        so one could compare them.
      </p>
      <h3>Exploration
      </h3>
      <p>In this section, we will beging the exploration of CO2 emissions using the final visualizations that I created.
        First, let's check out how CO2 emissions have been changing
        over the years for a select few countries: China, United States,
        Canada, Japan, Iran, and India. We are focusing in on these six
        countries because they are some of the highest CO2 emitting
        countries in the world.
        <li>Which country has become the leader in CO2 emissions in
          recent years?</li>
        <li>Which three countries have been the highest CO2 emitting
          countries since the early 2000s?</li>
        <li>What is the overall trend in CO2 emissions over time for
        all countries?</li>
      </p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 30px;">China has Become the Leader in CO2 Emissions in Recent Years</p>
      <p>The y-axis displays CO2 emissions in Tonnes of CO2.</p>

new Runtime().module(define, name => {
  if (name === "viewof lineChartCO2") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-viewof-lineChartCO2-87a8b234"));
});
</script>
<br>
      <p>Next, we will look at CO2 emissions and energy production over time for the top three CO2 emitting countries.
        <li>Which energy type contributes the most to CO2 emissions?</li>
        <li>Is there a relationship between CO2 emissions and energy production over time for each country? What is it?</li>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 30px;">Coal Production Contributes the Most to CO2 Emissions</p>
      <p>The y-axis dispays CO2 emissions in Tonnes of CO2 and Energy Production in Quant BTU. The graphs on the left are 
        plotting CO2 data, while the graphs on the right are plotting energy production data.

});
</script>
<br>
      <p>Finally, let's look at how the top three CO2 emitting countries have been
      changing their energy production patterns over time.
        <li>In the most recent years, how has coal production changed for each country?</li>
        <li>What countries have been increasing their "nuclear and other" energy?</li>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 30px;">China and the United States have decreased their coal production in recent years.</p>
      <p>The y-axis displays the percent of an energy type out of total energy production. The color areas represent the percentage 
        of the energy types. For a specific moment in time, the width of the color areas represent the current percentage.

        <h1>Forests and Deforestation</h1>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Much of the world's landamass is covered by forest. Forests account for 38% of all habitable land.
          That is over one-third of habitable land and around one qarter of the total landmass on this planet!
          This is a signinfant decrease from what it used to be. Currently half of all habitable land is used for
          agriculture.
          <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/forest-area">OurWorldInData</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Net Forestation Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Lets try to understand that decrease. We can think of forestation in terms of deforestation
          (loss of forest) and afforestation (gain of forest).
          Afforestation includes both natural forest expansion and supernatural expansion at the hands of humans.
          Thus, net forest change is not the same as defortestation,
          it inlcudes both losses and gains. Here we can see the net changes in forest cover from 1990 to 2015.
          Countries shown in yellow have experienced net deforestation, countires shown in blue have experienced net
          afforestation.
        </p>
       
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Brazil has experienced the most deforestation. China has experienced the most afforestation.</p>

        <p>Despite afforestation in some regions, it is not enough to make up for the loss of forest elsewhere. 
          If we want to preserve this natural rescource changes to our current agricultrual practices will need to be made.</p>

        <h3>Forest Distribution</h3>

        <p>Below we can see the total change in forest distribution expereinced by the most forested nations from 1990 to 2020. This helps us gain a better idea of 
          where deforestation and afforestation is occuring so we can take a deeper look into the happenings in these regions. 

          <li><i>note that some data may be double counted, for example the feild Asia includes data from China although China is also seen independently on the chart</i></li>

        <p>Below we can see the distribution of forest area across regions of the globe. The bubble visualizations are not that insightful but they were
          difficult to make and I leared a lot in the process of doing so. They are included to demonstrate the exploratory process of this project.
           
        </p>


        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Russia is home to the world's largest forest.</p>
        <p>Many think the Amazon in brazil is the largest forest.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 30px;"> Brazil, the United States, Canada, China, Australia, 
          and the Democratic Republic of Congo also contain a significant chunk of the global forest area.</p>

          We can see the shares of forest area accross world regions. We see that Europe, thanks to Russia,
          has the largest share of global forest area. This is followed by South America and then Africa.
          This has not changed over the past 30 years.

      <h1>The State of Water</h1>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>The effects of climate change and unsustainable use can be
        found in our oceans, lakes, and rivers. While water is essential
        to human life, it can also lead to dreadful consequences — land
        mass sinking coupled with rising sea levels can be the end of
        many coastal cities. Yet at the same time, freshwater resources
        have become scarce due to unsustainable water usage combined
        with the booming path of human population. How bad is it? Let’s
        look at the data.</p>
      <div>
        <h3>Sea Levels</h3>
        <p>It's been made publicly aware by scientists that sea levels
        are on the rise due to global warming. But how fast is the sea
        level rising?</p>

        <p>So how do these sea levels affect us? Specifically, let's
          look at the production of seafood in the United States. The
          following visualization displays the revenue of major US ports
          in millions of dollars. If we assumed a certain sea level
          change, would the port be unusuable due to rise in sea level?
          Which sea levels will affect the sea industry the most?

        <h3>Water Use</h3>
        <p>Water is a two-sided coin. While mass bodies of water have the potential of flooding ports and cities, we
          also need freshwater access to survive. Yet, due to human overpopulation, water scarcity has become more of an
          issue. In recent years, South Africa was noticed of Day Zero, a response to their water crisis. Unless water
          consumption patterns changed, scientists predicted that the countries freshwater supply would end. Water
          scarcity is an issue all over the globe and not just in South Africa. So we must ask ourselves, who has the
          most sustainable water consumption?</p>

          You as an indivual can effect real change. Here are some ideas to get you started:
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce meat from your diet - animal agirculture is a huge driver for deforestation</li>
          <li>Unsunbrice from junk emails - saves a lot energy!</li>
          <li>...</li>
