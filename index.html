      <h1>CO2 Emissions</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>CO2 emissions are the main contributor to global warming on
      Planet Earth, which has several other sideaffects such as
      melting ice caps, more severe weather, and bleaching of coral
      reefs. The main source of CO2 comes from the burning of fossil
      fules. Therefore, in this section we will focus on carbon
      emissions and energy production for every country contributing
      to our planetary crisis. </p>
      <h3>Example Insights</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Insight 1</h4>
        <p>Primary Insight: The China has become the highest contributor to global CO2 emissions since the year 2000, followed by the United States and India</p>
        <p>Secondary Insight: Overall, CO2 emissions have been increasing over time.</p>
        <h4>Insight 2</h4>
        <p>Primary Insight: For the top three CO2 emitting countries, coal production contributes the most to CO2 emissions out of 
          gas, petroleum, and nuclear and other.
        </p>
        <p>Secondary Insight: There is a correlation between energy production and CO2 emissions over time.</p>
        <h4>Insight 3</h4>
        <p>Primary Insight: The United States and China have reduced their coal production since 2005, while India has slightly increased it.</p>
        <p>Secondary Insight: China has increased its nuclear production to replace coal and petroleum, and India has increased 
          its nuclear production to replace gas and petroleum.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Exploration
      </h3>
      <p>First, let's check out how CO2 emissions have been changing
      over the years for a select few countries: China, United States,
      Canada, Japan, Iran, and India. We are focusing in on these six
      countries because they are some of the highest CO2 emitting
      countries in the world.
        <li>Which country has become the leader in CO2 emissions in
        recent years?</li>
        <li>Which three countries have been the highest CO2 emitting
        countries since the early 2000s?</li>
        <li>What is the overall trend in CO2 emissions over time for
        all countries?</li>
      </p><br>

      <p>Next, we will look at CO2 emissions and energy production over time for the top three CO2 emitting countries.
        <li>Which energy type contributes the most to CO2 emissions?</li>
        <li>Is there a relationship between CO2 emissions and energy production over time for each country? What is it?</li>

      <p>Finally, let's look at how the top three CO2 emitting countries have been
      changing their energy production patterns over time.
        <li>In the most recent years, how has coal production changed for each country?</li>
        <li>What countries have been increasing their "nuclear and other" energy and why do you think that is given the other energy types displayed?</li>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 30px;">China and the United States have decreased their coal production in recent years.</p>
      <p>The y-axis displays the percent of an energy type out of total energy production.</p>

      <h1>Forests and Deforestation</h1>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      // add source
      <p> 
        Much of the world's landamass is covered by forest. Forests account for 38% of all habitable land. 
        That is over one-third of habitable land and around one qarter of the total landmass on this planet! 
        This is a signinfant decrease from what it used to be. Currently half of all habitable land is used for agriculture.
      </p>

      <h3>Net Forestation Changes</h3>
      <p>
        Lets try to understand that decrease. We can think of forestatio in terms of deforestation (loss of forest) and afforestation (gain of forest).
        Afforestation includes both natureal forest expansion and supernatural expansion at the hands of humans. 
        Thus, net forest change is not the same as defortestation, it inlcudes both losses and gains. Here we can see the net changes in forest cover from 1990 to 2015. 
        Countries shown in yellow have experienced net deforestation, countires shown in blue have experienced net afforestation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can see that Russia has experienced the highest gain of net forest of any nation and Brazil, the highest loss of net forest area.

      });

      <h3>Forest Distribution</h3>
      <p>Here we can see the shares of forest area accross world regions. We see that Europe, thanks to Russia, 
        has the largest share of global forest area. This is followed by South America and then Africa.

      <h1>The State of Water</h1>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>The effects of climate change and unsustainable use can be
      found in our oceans, lakes, and rivers. While water is essential
      to human life, it can also lead to dreadful consequences — land
      mass sinking coupled with rising sea levels can be the end of
      many coastal cities. Yet at the same time, freshwater resources
      have become scarce due to unsustainable water usage combined
      with the booming path of human population. How bad is it? Let’s
      look at the data.</p>
      <div>
        <h3>Sea Levels</h3>
        <p>It's been made publicly aware by scientists that sea levels
        are on the rise due to global warming. But how fast is the sea
        level rising?</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="734" frameborder="0"
        src="https://observablehq.com/embed/c88624e55f2ef23f?cells=sealevels_chart"></iframe>
        <p>So how do these sea levels affect us? Specifically, let's
        look at the production of seafood in the United States. The
        following visualization displays the revenue of major US ports
        in millions of dollars. If we assumed a certain sea level
        change, would the port be unusuable due to rise in sea level?
        Which sea levels will affect the sea industry the most?
        </p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="734" frameborder="0"
        src="https://observablehq.com/embed/c88624e55f2ef23f?cells=viewof+elevation_gain%2Cseafood_chart"></iframe>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Water Use</h3>
        <p>Water is a two-sided coin. While mass bodies of water have the potential of flooding ports and cities, we also need freshwater access to survive. Yet, due to human overpopulation, water scarcity has become more of an issue. In recent years, South Africa was noticed of Day Zero, a response to their water crisis. Unless water consumption patterns changed, scientists predicted that the countries freshwater supply would end. Water scarcity is an issue all over the globe and not just in South Africa. So we must ask ourselves, who has the most sustainable water consumption?</p>
