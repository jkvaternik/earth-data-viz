      <h1>CO2 Emissions</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>CO2 emissions are the main contributor to global warming on
        Planet Earth, which has several other sideaffects such as
        melting ice caps, more severe weather, and bleaching of coral
        reefs. The main source of CO2 comes from the burning of fossil
        fules. Therefore, in this section we will focus on carbon
        emissions and energy production for every country contributing
        to our planetary crisis. </p>
      <h3>Example Insights</h3>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>In this section, I display the process of coming up with my
        final visualizations.</p>
      <h4>Energy Production Over Time</h4>
      <p>For this visualization, I originally tried creating a bar
        chart for each country, and having a user input scroll bar to
        choose what year the bar charts represented. The idea was to
        convey how the distributions of energy types changed over time.
      </p>
      <div id="observablehq-viewof-distributionYear-d25631b5"></div>
      <div id="observablehq-viewof-energyDistributions-d25631b5"></div>

      <script type="module">
        import { Runtime, Inspector } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";
        import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@akaufmann038/final-project.js?v=3";
        new Runtime().module(define, name => {
          if (name === "viewof distributionYear") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-viewof-distributionYear-d25631b5"));
          if (name === "viewof energyDistributions") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-viewof-energyDistributions-d25631b5"));
          return ["getData", "energyDistributions", "getEnergyViz", "energyAndCo2Plot"].includes(name);
        });
      </script>
      <p>The issue with this visualization is that it did not
        effectively show how the distributions changed over time. I
        ended up using area charts for each country to show the
        distributions of energy production over time.
      </p>
      <h4>What contributes to CO2 emissions.</h4>
      <p>In this visualization, I wanted to show which energy types
        contributed most to CO2 emissions. I attempted to do this by
        normalizing the data by calculating the standard deviations of
        CO2 and all of the energy types.</p>
      <div id="observablehq-viewof-stdLineChart-c20ea3d7"></div>


      <script type="module">
        import { Runtime, Inspector } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";
        import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@akaufmann038/final-project.js?v=3";
        new Runtime().module(define, name => {
          if (name === "viewof stdLineChart") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-viewof-stdLineChart-c20ea3d7"));
        });
      </script>
      <p>This issue with this visualization was that there was no
        clear way to interpret the fluctuations in the lines since my
        unit was a standard deviation. I ended up displaying CO2
        emissions and the distributions of energy types next to each
        other so one could compare them.
      </p>
      <h3>Exploration
      </h3>
      <p>In this section, we will beging the exploration of CO2
        emissions using the final visualizations that I created. First,
        let's check out how CO2 emissions have been changing over the
        years for a select few countries: China, United States, Canada,
        Japan, Iran, and India. We are focusing in on these six
        countries because they are some of the highest CO2 emitting
        countries in the world.
        <li>Which country has become the leader in CO2 emissions in
          recent years?</li>
        <li>Which three countries have been the highest CO2 emitting
          countries since the early 2000s?</li>
        <li>What is the overall trend in CO2 emissions over time for
          all countries?</li>
      </p><br>

      <script type="module">

        import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@akaufmann038/final-project.js?v=3";
        new Runtime().module(define, name => {
          if (name === "viewof lineChartCO2") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-viewof-lineChartCO2-87a8b234"));
        });
      </script>
      <br>
      <p>Next, we will look at CO2 emissions and energy production
        over time for the top three CO2 emitting countries.
        <li>Which energy type contributes the most to CO2
          emissions?</li>
        <li>Is there a relationship between CO2 emissions and energy
          production over time for each country? What is it?
        </li>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 30px;">Coal Production Contributes the Most

        Production in Quant BTU. The graphs on the left are plotting CO2
        data, while the graphs on the right are plotting energy
        production data.

        });
      </script>
      <br>
      <p>Finally, let's look at how the top three CO2 emitting
        countries have been changing their energy production patterns
        over time.
        <li>In the most recent years, how has coal production changed
          for each country?</li>
        <li>What countries have been increasing their "nuclear and
          other" energy?</li>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 30px;">China and the United States have
        decreased their coal production in recent years.</p>
      <p>The y-axis displays the percent of an energy type out of
        total energy production. The color areas represent the
        percentage of the energy types. For a specific moment in time,
        the width of the color areas represent the current percentage.

        <h1>Forests and Deforestation</h1>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Much of the world's landamass is covered by forest. Forests
          account for 38% of all habitable land. That is over
          one-third of habitable land and around one qarter of the
          total landmass on this planet! This is a signinfant decrease
          from what it used to be. Currently half of all habitable
          land is used for agriculture.
          <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/forest-area">OurWorldInData</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Net Forestation Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Lets try to understand that decrease. We can think of
          forestation in terms of deforestation (loss of forest) and
          afforestation (gain of forest). Afforestation includes both
          natural forest expansion and supernatural expansion at the
          hands of humans. Thus, net forest change is not the same as
          defortestation, it inlcudes both losses and gains. Here we
          can see the net changes in forest cover from 1990 to 2015.
          Countries shown in yellow have experienced net
          deforestation, countires shown in blue have experienced net
          afforestation.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Brazil has experienced the most
          deforestation. China has experienced the most
          afforestation.</p>

        <p>Despite afforestation in some regions, it is not enough to
          make up for the loss of forest elsewhere. If we want to
          preserve this natural rescource changes to our current
          agricultrual practices will need to be made.</p>

        <h3>Forest Distribution</h3>

        <p>Below we can see the total change in forest distribution
          expereinced by the most forested nations from 1990 to 2020.
          This helps us gain a better idea of where deforestation and
          afforestation is occuring so we can take a deeper look into
          the happenings in these regions.

          insightful but they were difficult to make and I leared a lot
          in the process of doing so. They are included to demonstrate
          the exploratory process of this project.

        <p>Many think the Amazon in brazil is the largest forest.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 30px;"> Brazil, the United States,
          Canada, China, Australia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo

          We can see the shares of forest area accross world regions.
          We see that Europe, thanks to Russia, has the largest share
          of global forest area. This is followed by South America and
          then Africa. This has not changed over the past 30 years.

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>The effects of climate change and unsustainable use can be
        found in our oceans, lakes, and rivers. While water is essential
        to human life, it can also lead to dreadful consequences — land
        mass sinking coupled with rising sea levels can be the end of
        many coastal cities. Yet at the same time, freshwater resources
        have become scarce due to unsustainable water usage combined
        with the booming trend of human population. The following
        sections look at the effects created by rising sea levels as
        well as the results of human water consumption.</p>
      <div>
        <h3>Part I: Ports vs. Rising Sea Levels</h3>
        <p>With a growing human population and increasing
          temperatures, sea levels have been rising at an increasing
          rate since the early 1900s. The following visualization
          presents sea level data collected from CSIRO (Commonwealth
          Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation).</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="684" frameborder="0"

        <p>
          <b>Dataset:</b>
          <a href="https://datahub.io/core/sea-level-rise">Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change, 1880-2014</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Coupled with the sinking of land masses, rising sea-levels
          have the potential of flooding multiple cities and impacting
          the seafood economy. Here we can look at how rising sea levels
          could flood cities and surrounding major ports — leaving them
          unable to function.

          Researchers and scientists have warned about the
          consequences of global warming towards rising sea levels.
          According to a study by Scott A. Kulp and Benjamin H. Strauss,
          sea levels are projected to rise by 2 meters at the end of
          the twenty-first century under high carbon emissions. How
          would this affect major U.S. ports? Who would be
          affected? The following visualization displays the revenue of
          major US ports in millions of dollars. If we assumed a
          certain sea level change, would the port be unusuable due to
          rise in sea level? Which sea levels will affect the sea
          industry the most?

        <p>
          At the 2 meters suggested by Kulp and Strauss, the U.S.
          loses roughly $472.2 million due to the instability of these
          regions caused by rising sea levels. Additionally, even with
          sharp, immediate cuts to carbon emissions, it could rise
          another 0.5 m this century — jeopardizing $192.1 million of
          the seafood economy. This could only worsen as the same
          circumstances would extend to other countries as well —
          impacting the global seafood chain.This issue will require
          innovative solutions to mitigate our effect on increasing
          temperatures and increasing sea levels to maintain
          communities and economies afloat.

        <h3>Water Use</h3>
        <p>Water is a two-sided coin. While mass bodies of water have
          the potential of flooding ports and cities, we also need
          freshwater access to survive. Yet, due to growing human
          populations, water scarcity has become more of an issue. In
          recent years, South Africa was warned of Day Zero, a response
          to their water crisis in 2018. Unless water consumption
          patterns changed, scientists predicted that the countries
          freshwater supply would end. However, this water crisis
          extends farther than South Africa, as 5.0 of 9.7
          billion people (or 52% of the global population) in the world
          will be living in water stressed regions by 2050. So, which
          regions are currently experiencing higher levels of water stress?</p>

            <a href="https://www.sdg6data.org/tables">UN — Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources</a>
          </p>
        <p>
          Many countries with a high freshwater withdrawal of
          available freshwater resources are located in arid regions,
          which leads to the question — what can be done? The global
          water crisis is a global problem and requires the assistance
          of each individual. One solution is reducing a us Well the
          problem doesn't just lie there. Using this information,
          let's turn to global water withdrawal rates to see which
          countries need to change their water consumption patterns to
          avoid running out of water.
        </p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="684" frameborder="0"
          src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@jkvaternik/water-a-two-sided-coin?cells=freshwater_chart"></iframe>
          <p>
            <b>Datasets:</b>
            <a href="https://www.sdg6data.org/tables">UN — Total water withdrawal per capita</a>,
            <a href="https://www.sdg6data.org/tables">UN — Gross domestic product (GDP), per capita (USD)</a>
          </p>
        <p>
          In the visualization above, countries are mapped by their
          annual total water withdrawal per person in cubic meters by
          their respective GDP per capita. The sustainable freshwater
          withdrawal benchmark was suggested by Arjen Hoekstra, a
          reknowned professor of water management at the University of
          Twente, Enschede, the Netherlands based on projected
          population grown and available water resources.

          Now, let's add another measure: a GDP benchmark for developing
          countries to see which if more developing countries or developed
          countries support an unsustainable water consumption:
        </p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="684" frameborder="0"
          src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@jkvaternik/water-a-two-sided-coin?cells=freshwater_chart_developing"></iframe>
        <p>
          Interestingly, there are more developed countries with
          unsustainable water consumption patterns than developing
          countries. One possible reason is the consumer culture in
          these countries. Our freshwater withdrawal consists of two
          types of water; indirect and direct water consumption. While
          water conservation tips such as taking shorter showers and
          turning off running water while brushing your teeth or
          washing the dishes aim to reduce direct consumption, it's
          our indirect consumption that hinders our sustainable
          efforts. Unhealthy, meat-heavy diets and consumerist
          patterns are large perpetrators to our high water
          consumption.

          So, how do these countries fare with water scarcity? Are more
          countries in water stressed conditions? Let's turn back to our global
          visualization with a focus on these countries with unsustainable water
          consumption patterns.
        </p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="608" frameborder="0"
          src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@jkvaternik/water-a-two-sided-coin?cells=chart_legend%2Cunsustainable_water_chart"></iframe>
        <p>While more developed countries have unsustainable water
          consumption rates, those same countries do not appear to be
          in high or critical water-stress conditions (&lt50%).
          Unfortunately, these countries may not realize the
          consequences of their actions yet, but could be in water
          stress conditions based on their current trajectory. We can
          also observe the water consumption and water stress
          conditions of the countries with lower GDP versus higher GDP
          in the next visualization.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="1283" frameborder="0"
          src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@jkvaternik/water-a-two-sided-coin?cells=viewof+gdp%2Cfreshwater_chart_developing_unsustainable%2Cchart_legend2%2Cdeveloping_unsustainable_water_chart"></iframe>
        <p>Countries with lower GDP are typically in more stressed
          water conditions (&gt50%) with the exception of Indonesia. Water
          scarcity can have effects on a countries social and economic
          health as water becomes more of a priority. Residents of these
          regions must focus more on retrieving water rather than
          economic or social productivity. However, through the help of
          neighboring countries and the reduction of their water
          consumption to a sustainable level, these regions could
          benefit socially and economically.</p>
